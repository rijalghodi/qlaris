# About project

Qlaris is a POS (Point of Sale) application for UMKM (Micro and small businesses) in Indonesia.

Qlaris is designed to be **simple, fast, and practical**, focusing on daily operational needs such as selling products, managing stock, and tracking sales without complex setup or training.  
It is built for **offline stores** (retail, food & beverage, kiosks) where speed, clarity, and reliability matter more than advanced analytics.

The goal of Qlaris is to help business owners **sell immediately**, understand their business performance at a glance, and grow step by step without being overwhelmed by features.

**Tagline:**  
Simple POS for everyday selling
